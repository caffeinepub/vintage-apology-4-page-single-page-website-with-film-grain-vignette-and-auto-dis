  "summary": "A standalone `frontend/public/apology.html` was added and appears to include inline CSS, Google Fonts (Poppins + Dancing Script), dark background `#0a0a0a`, and some page/game styling. However, the diff also includes numerous React/Tailwind app changes and new components that were not requested (the request explicitly asked for only an additional standalone `apology.html` and to not replace/alter the existing React flow). Due to truncation of `apology.html`, several required exact-copy/behavior items cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The added `apology.html` content is truncated before any \"Next\" button markup/logic or the inline <script> is shown, so the sequential 5-step Next-driven navigation and inline JS behavior cannot be confirmed from the diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Include the exact specified page copy for Pages 1–5, including Page 4 question and Page 5 final text + image below.",
      "reason": "Only partial styling and some page-specific CSS class names are visible in the truncated excerpt; the actual HTML content for Pages 2–5 (and even confirmation of Page 1 exact string) is not shown, so exact text/copy compliance cannot be verified.",

      "requirement": "On Page 4, implement robust No-button evasion (near-hover and touch/pointer proximity), clamped within viewport using measured button dimensions; clicking/tapping No should just move it again (no successful No action).",
      "reason": "The excerpt shows CSS for `.yes-button` and references a game section, but the JavaScript implementing proximity detection, touch handling, viewport clamping, and click suppression/move-on-click is not included in the truncated diff, so the required behavior cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "The truncated `apology.html` excerpt does not show the Page 5 image markup or any comment about renaming the file, so this requirement cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals explicitly say the deliverable is an additional standalone `apology.html` file and to not replace the existing React flow/components unless explicitly requested; the diff summary indicates many React/Tailwind files were modified/added.",
