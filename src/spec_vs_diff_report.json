Page 2 text and a Next button are present; Page 4 has the exact prompt, correct Yes/No labels, and an evasive No button on hover/touch/click. The diff provides no evidence for the overall 5-page flow controller, smooth animated transitions, global theme/font enforcement, Page 1/3/5 exact content/layout, or the required generated hugging GIF asset under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
